- Please see the mockup to understand more about the design.
- I haven't remove some of Guro files yet, it was a Simple-Todo-App before. You may found that there lot of are unused files in the src. Just leave them first, It might be good examples to see how the AngularJS staff works.
- You can try to understand the code as you want and try to code the 'filter' part as i was mentioned or you might want to design the 'User activity page', see the mockup.
